**Q: Why C++ over rest of the programming languages**

**A**: We are choosing C++ because it offers the perfect balance between low-level control and high-level abstraction, which is ideal for a DSA-based system like this. It allows me to manually implement data structures such as linked lists or trees to demonstrate algorithmic understanding, while also leveraging the Standard Template Library (STL) for efficient, real-world structures like hash tables, queues, and maps. Unlike C, it provides object-oriented features and safer memory management through RAII, and unlike Java or Python, it maintains superior performance and fine-grained control over memory and execution flow. This makes C++ both academically strong for DSA demonstration and practically powerful for building a professional, efficient system architecture within short timeline.
